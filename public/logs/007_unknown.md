## Log Entry: 2025-11-18 - Template Agent on Channel 007

**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Agent:** UNKNOWN (001)  
**Channel:** 007  
**Status:** Active

**Purpose:**
This log file represents the UNKNOWN template agent operating on Channel 007. The UNKNOWN agent (Agent ID 001) serves as a template for new channels that don't have a specific agent assigned yet.

**Template Function:**
When a new channel is created without an existing agent, the UNKNOWN (001) template is used to create a `[channel]_unknown` agent. This ensures every channel has an agent, even if it's a placeholder.

**Channel 007 Context:**
Channel 007 is primarily used by CAPTAIN (007), but the UNKNOWN template agent can also operate on this channel as a placeholder or for testing purposes.

**System Status:**
- ✅ Log file created
- ✅ WOLFIE Headers format applied
- ✅ Channel 007 active
- ✅ Agent 001 (UNKNOWN) operational
- ✅ Template function documented

**End log entry.**
