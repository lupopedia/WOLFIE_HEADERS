WHY DUAL LICENSE?
================================================================================

GPL v3: 
- Strong copyleft (modifications must be open-source)
- Community protection (prevents proprietary forks)
- "NO WARRANTY" clause protects developer from liability

Apache 2.0:
- Permissive (allows commercial use, proprietary modifications)
- Business-friendly (enterprises prefer Apache)
- Patent grant (explicit patent protection)

Choose GPL if you want to contribute back to open source.
Choose Apache if you need commercial/proprietary use.

Both licenses include "AS IS" / "NO WARRANTY" disclaimers that protect
LUPOPEDIA LLC and Eric Robin Gerdes from liability if software causes damage.
