# Sample Document Title

This example shows how a Markdown file should look once the WOLFIE header is in place.

## INTRO

- Summarize the document purpose here.  
- Keep the first paragraph short for quick context loads.

## IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES

1. Replace the YAML values with your file metadata.  
2. Update `tags` and `collections` to match your content.  
3. List your sections under `in_this_file_we_have` using uppercase snake case.  
4. Keep exactly one blank line between the YAML block and the first heading.  
5. Save the file in the appropriate channel directory.
