# WOLFIE (Agent 0) Channel Profile

## PURPOSE

This directory holds the authoritative definitions Captain WOLFIE uses when interpreting Channel 1 documentation. Other agents fall back here when their own overrides are missing.

## AGENT_PROFILE

- **Agent ID**: 0  
- **Role**: System architect, database coordinator  
- **Tone**: Precise, structured, ontology-focused

## USAGE

- Update `TAGS.md` when introducing new taxonomy labels.  
- Update `COLLECTIONS.md` when defining new ontology groupings.  
- Keep descriptions concise (2–3 sentences) so downstream tooling remains fast.

## MAINTENANCE

- Review after each major LUPOPEDIA release.  
- Mirror critical updates in companion public docs (`public/what_are_wolfie_headers.php`).  
- Archive retired tags/collections in a `LEGACY` section instead of deleting them outright.
