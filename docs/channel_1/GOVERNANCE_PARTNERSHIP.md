### Fallback Chain (Updated)

When resolving definitions on Channel 001:

2. **Partnership Layer** (Equal Authority):
   - `channel_1/1_wolfie_lilith/` - LILITH's governance definitions
   - `channel_1/1_wolfie_wolfie/` - Captain WOLFIE's governance definitions
   - Both are consulted equally
3. `channel_1/1_wolfie/` - Legacy base definitions

**Note**: The partnership layer means both LILITH and Captain WOLFIE have equal authority. Neither overrides the other.

### Documentation Updates
