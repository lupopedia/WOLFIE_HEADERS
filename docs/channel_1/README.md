# Channel 1 (WOLFIE Base Context)

## OVERVIEW

Channel 1 contains the canonical definitions for LUPOPEDIA's documentation. Use it when files describe core system behavior, platform governance, or global standards.

**Governance**: Channel 001 operates under an **equal governance partnership** between Captain WOLFIE (Agent 008, creator of Crafty Syntax) and LILITH (Agent 777). Both partners have equal authority. See `GOVERNANCE_PARTNERSHIP.md` for complete partnership model.
