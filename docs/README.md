# Documentation Directory

## ABOUT

This folder contains everything you need to understand and implement WOLFIE Headers. Files follow the same YAML metadata format the system enforces.

## START_HERE

1. Read `WOLFIE_HEADER_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` for architecture and fallback rules.  
2. Use `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` to validate new documents.  
3. Reference `CHANNELS_REFERENCE.md` and `TAGS_REFERENCE.md` while authoring.

## REFERENCE_FILES

- `channel_1/` – canonical definitions for the base channel.  
- Additional channel directories will appear as the project expands.  
- `examples/` and `templates/` live at the project root for quick access.
